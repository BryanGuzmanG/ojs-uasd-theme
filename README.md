# Customized UASD theme for OJS 3+

A university-built theme for OJS 3+ that implements Bootstrap 3 components.

## Installation

This theme can be installed through the **Plugin Gallery** in Open Journal Systems. If it's not available in the plugin gallery, you may need to update Open Journal Systems to a compatible version.

## Project Aims
The goal was to stay true to Bootstrap 3's core components, so that developers familiar with the HTML, CSS and JavaScript framework can more easily read and customize the code base. By sticking close to Bootstrap 3's supported components, the theme is able to more easily leverage the many existing Bootstrap 3 resources out there.

## Contribution

This theme is a work-in-progress. It may not support all features of OJS 3.0 and some of the bundled themes could use some polish. It's intended to act as a base for custom development, but many journals may use it out-of-the-box.

If you see something that could be improved, please issue a Pull Request.
